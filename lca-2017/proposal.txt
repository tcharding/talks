Getting started with kernel development can be a daunting task. As the kernel
continues to grow in both size and complexity the task is not getting any
easier. This presentation aims to give newbie kernel developers some guidance on
finding interesting, useful things to work on within the kernel and within the
kernel community at large.

First we will give a brief run down on one method for acquiring the technical
skills to be able to contribute. Next we will touch on some of the social skills
required to participate. We will discuss briefly motivation for doing this sort
of work before moving on to some specific tips for finding things to work on
that are at once interesting, and tractable, both being essential if one wishes
to progress as a developer.
